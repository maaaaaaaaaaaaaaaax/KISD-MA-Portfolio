### About Me
I am a Master's student at KISD, TH Köln, and I am in the process of completing my degree in Integrated Design Research. I have a background in programming and rapid prototyping from my BA. I am currently writing my MA thesis, which explores the topic of sabotage in artificial intelligence. I am deeply interested in the cultural and political impact of technology, web-to-print technologies and interactivity. As an interdisciplinary designer and programmer, I enjoy working with both analogue and digital technologies. My work often deals with 'technocritical' and 'technoexplorative' topics.
